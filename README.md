# Alien-Invasion-Game
A simple 2D game written in Python and Pygame

## Gameplay
In Alien Invasion!, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the (R / L) arrow keys and shoot bullets using the (SPACEBAR). When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends. The previous highest score is saved upon exiting the game.
